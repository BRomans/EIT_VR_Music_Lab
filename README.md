# EIT XRMusicLab
Project part of Design, Serious Game and Mixed Reality classes.

VRMusicLab is a virtual reality serious game for people who wish to learn music composition from the very basics. It’s part of a XR system called ‘XRMusicLab’ that also features an AR game that completes the experience with a virtual DJ console powered by Leap Motion.
The game has been implemented using Unity for Oculus using the OVR sdk.

The main concept we want to address is experimentation. We want people to be able at some point to just be creative following patterns and best practices suggested by music experts.
The idea is to build music using interactive objects, like blocks, and build music as a composition of those blocks. We make use of pillars-like objects to give the players a physical representation of the components of the song they are composing. 
The game will include two different modes, the first one will be for training and learning music composition, the second will be for experimenting with what you have learned.


## Scenario
You are a newborn God of Music and you are given the mission of bringing the music “back” to the world by learning step by step all the fundamental concepts and tools needed to compose music.  But other minor Gods also want to do it, so you have to do your best to prove your ability.
During your apprenticeship you will be guided by the Supreme God of Music into the main aspects of music composition until you’ll be able to freely experiment and create on your own. Follow the training to complete your achievements and unlock new powerful tools.


# Research
The project has been inspired by a research about music composition and game-based learning.
